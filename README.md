Software Engineering Day1 Assignment


#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering applies engineering principles, methodologies, and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Its importance is that it reduces complexity, handling big project, minimize software cost, and creates a reliable software


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 Mastering the Machine (1956–1967): The term software engineering had not yet been coined. Code development was strongly influenced by outside forces. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources
 Mastering the Process (1968–1982): The first software crisis in this stage led to the birth of software engineering [1]. The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation.
 Mastering the Complexity (1983–1992): The up to then dominion of hardware over software ended. Personal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer applications. The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement analysis: This stage of the SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, salespeople, industry experts, and programmers
Planning: In this stage of the SDLC, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the analyzed requirements
Architectural design: This phase of the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification.
Software development: The actual development starts at this stage
Testing: In this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those issues until the product meets the original specifications.
Software Deployment: At this stage, the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can start using the product


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISON
Each member has pre determined role in both methodologies
The software has tobe delivered after completion in both methodologies
CONTRAST
Waterfall delivers the results only at the end of the project while agile deliver reults oftenly and continously
Changes have to be managed and controlled to prevent negative effect in waterfall while in agile methodologies enable changes more easily.
The end product is defined and fixed in waterfall while in agile, requirements change is supported

Projects with high levels of uncertainty surrounding timeline, budget, and resources are great candidates for the Agile method while wide variety of projects are good candidates for the Waterfall model, including projects with well-defined requirements, small or highly focused projects, projects that do not have a rigid timeline and repeatable projects that follow similar steps each time



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer can take on different roles in a development team. From planning to deployment, they are a key fixture in any development project
Quality Assurance Engineers play a pivotal role in the industry, ensuring that the quality and safety standards of products and services are upheld
Project manager is responsible for identifying project goalsand scope, managing all project resources, ensure effective communication with stake holders and ensuring top-quality results and project success


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment or IDE is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. example is Microsoft Visual Studio
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. its benefits is to Leverages the productivity, expedites product delivery, and skills of the employees through better communication and assistance. example is git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

CHALLANGES:
Requirement violation
Limited budget and resources
Lack of communication and collaboration
Poor software quality and maintenance
Adapting to changing technology and industry trends

Overcoming Challenges of Software Engineering
Embrace continous learning
Balancing innovation and maintenance
Collaborate and share knowledge
Stakeholder alignment and understanding


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the first level of testing usually performed by the developers.In unit testing, a module or component is tested in isolation
Integration testing is the second level of testing in which we test a group of related modules.
System Testing is the third level of testing.It is the level of testing where the complete integrated application is tested as a whole.
Acceptance testing is the final and one of the most important levels of testing on successful completion of which the application is released to production.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of iterating a generative AI prompt to improve its accuracy and effectiveness.
It increases precision and clarity, efficiency , controle over output and enhances exploration and innovation.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
